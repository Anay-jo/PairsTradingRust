PAIRS TRADING PROJECT

Clone the repository by running "git clone https://github.com/Anay-jo/PairsTradingRust.git".

After all that, simply run "cargo run" in your terminal to run the code.

Once you run the program, you will be prompted to enter a ticker symbol. Type in the ticker symbol of the first stock you want to use and then click enter.
Do the same again when prompted to type in the second ticker symbol.
Lastly, type in how much money you want to invest when prompted.

After this, the program will run the algorithm and output its recommendation to the user.

And that's it!
