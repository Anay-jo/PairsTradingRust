Project Introduction: Our goal is to create a pairs trading algorithm on stocks in the tech market. The user will input two stocks, how much money they want to invest, a floor value for loss, and a ceiling value for profit. We will output how many shares to invest in the stock they want to long and how many shares to invest in the stock they want to short based on their inputs.
